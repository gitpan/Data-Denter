Data::Denter - An alternative to Data::Dumper and Storable.

INTRODUCTION:

Data::Denter is yet another Perl data serializer/deserializer. It formats nested data structures in an indented fashion. It is optimized for human readability/editability, safe deserialization, and (eventually) speed.

NOTE: It may be optimized for Python programmers too, but please don't hold that against me ;)

It exports 2 functions: C<Indent()> and C<Undent()> for serialization and deserialization respectively. It handles all of the commonly serializable Perl data types, including: scalars, hash refs, array refs, scalar refs, ref refs, undef, and blessed references. It can even properly handle circular and duplicate references.

SAMPLE:

    use Data::Denter;
    print Indent bless {foo => 42, 
                        bar => [ 'happy', undef, [], 'sad' ],
                        baz => "Bozo the Clown",
                       }, "Small::Example";

yields:

    %Small::Example
        bar => @
            happy
            ?
            @
            sad
        baz => Bozo the Clown
        foo => 42

CHANGES: 

(Version 0.13)
- Fixed scalar context bug in Undent.

(Version 0.12)
- URI style escaping for binary data.
- Hash keys are sorted by default for the Indent() function. Controlled by the "Sort" option.
- Added "HashMode" option for creating quick and easy config files.
- Added "MaxLines" option for limiting the output of very long string values.
- Fixed bug. Now works with 5.7.0+.
