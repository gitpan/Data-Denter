Data::Denter - An alternative to Data::Dumper and Storable.

INTRODUCTION:

Data::Denter is yet another Perl data serializer/deserializer. It formats nested data structures in an indented fashion. It is optimized for human readability/editability, safe deserialization, and (eventually) speed. 

NOTE: It may be optimized for Python programmers too, but please don't hold that against me ;)

It exports 2 functions: C<Indent()> and C<Undent()> for serialization and deserialization respectively. It handles all of the commonly serializable Perl data types, including: scalars, hash refs, array refs, scalar refs, ref refs, undef, and blessed references. It can even properly handle circular and duplicate references.

SAMPLE:

    use Data::Denter;
    print Indent bless {foo => 42, 
                        bar => [ 'happy', undef, [], 'sad' ],
                        baz => "Bozo the Clown",
                       }, "Small::Example";

yields:

    %Small::Example
        baz => Bozo the Clown
        bar => @
            happy
            ?
            @
            sad
        foo => 42
